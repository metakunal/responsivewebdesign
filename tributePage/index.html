            <strong><p id="tribute-heading">Here's a time line of Mr. Torvald's life:</p></strong>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1969</strong> - Linus Benedict Torvalds was born December 28, 1969 in Helsinki Finland.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - At age eleven, Torvalds got his first taste of programming on a Commodore Vic 20, an early personal computer given to him by his grandfather. It was on this computer where Linus started writing code in the BASIC programming language.</li>
                <li><strong>1988</strong> - Torvalds decides to enroll in the University of Helsinki as a computer science major.</li>
                <li><strong>1991</strong> - Torvalds first announced his intention to create a UNIX and MINIX based kernel in the MINIX newsgroup comp.os.minix. He was primarily interested in getting feedback so he could improve his project.</li>
                <li><strong>1991</strong> - In 1991, Linus completes work on the first version (0.01) of the Linux operating system. At this point the project consisted of 10,000 lines of code and was fairly rudimentary compared to later versions.</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong> - Completes his master's Degree</li>
                <li><strong>1997</strong> - Torvalds joined the steering committee to try and form a consensus on a common binary file format that would be used on UNIX-like systems.</li>
                <li><strong>1997</strong> - In 1997, Torvalds received an honorary doctorate from Stockholm University for his contributions to software.</li>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> - Awarded the pioneer award by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for his development of Linux.</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> - Despite the popularity of his software, Torvalds made very little compared to others major figures in the industry due to his beliefs about free software. This changed in 1999, when the companies Red Hat and VA Linux offered him stock options as a thank you for creating Linux. This made him a millionaire when the stocks later went public.</li>
                <li><strong>2003</strong> - Linus decided to leave Transmeta and join the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), which later became the Linux Foundation. Here he would continue his work full-time as the ultimate authority on the Linux kernel.</li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - After realizing that he could no longer use the BitKeeper system of version control for legal reasons and unhappy with other systems, Linus decided to write his own version control system. Working through a weekend, Linus completed the project and named it Git. It is currently one of the most popular systems of version control used today.</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> - Released the initial version of the software Subsurface, a free and open source software that is used to collect data when scuba diving.</li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong> - Today, Linus continues his work on Linux as a fellow of the Linux Foundation, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to the advancement of Linux and collaborative development projects.</li>
               

                
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The cyberspace earnings I get from Linux come in the format of having a Network of people that know me and trust me, and that I can depend on in return.
                That's what makes Linux so good: you put in something, and that effort multiplies. It's a positive feedback cycle.</p></blockquote>
